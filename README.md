# self-balancing-unicycle
PID controlled Unicycle/Inverted Pendulum Simulator in C++

# Setting Up The Source Code
## Requirements
1. Install Git
2. Install CMake
3. Install C++ compiler

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/gavintranquilino/ml-unicycle.git
```

## Setting up the build with CMake
1. Create a build/ and bin/ folder at the project root
```
mkdir build 
mkdir bin
```

2. Change directory to build 
```
cd build
```

3. Build Makefile with CMake from source
- This step can be skipped if it was ran previously
- Or if a new library is created and needs to be included in the build
```
cmake -S ../ -B .
```

4. Build with Makefile
```
cmake --build .
```

5. Run the .exe
```
../bin/unicycle.exe
```
